# Accessibility (A11y)

- Use semantic HTML and labels.
- Manage focus on route changes and modals.
- Test with axe, Lighthouse.

```tsx
<label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
<input id="email" type="email" aria-required="true" />
```
**Expected result:** Screen readers announce label and requirements.
